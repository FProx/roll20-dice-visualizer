# Roll20 Dice Vizualizer

During a session of dnd a friend of mine complained that he only ever rolled low numbers. I did not feel as if he rolled particularly poorly and decided to investigate his and the rest of our groups dice result over the course of the entire campaign[^1].

## Requirements

This tool requires that matplotlib, numpy, pandas, and seaborn are present. You can use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install them.

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy pandas seaborn
```

## Usage

To see a full overview of available options and what they do, use:

```bash
python diceroll_visualization.py -h
```

[^1]: It turned out that my intuition was wrong and he did in fact roll a bit worse than average.
